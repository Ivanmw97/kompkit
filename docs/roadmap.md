# Roadmap

KompKit Core is in early development. This roadmap outlines planned features and improvements.

## Current phase: Stability and parity

The focus is on:
- Ensuring API consistency between web and android implementations
- Expanding test coverage
- Fixing bugs and edge cases
- Improving documentation

## Upcoming utilities

- `throttle` - Throttle function calls to a maximum rate
- `clamp` - Clamp a number between min and max values
- `deepEqual` - Deep equality comparison for objects
- `retry` - Retry failed async operations with backoff
- `sleep` - Promise-based delay utility

## Design tokens (future)

- Color palettes
- Typography scales
- Spacing systems
- Cross-platform theme definitions

## Documentation site

- Dedicated docs site with interactive examples
- API reference auto-generated from source
- Live playground for testing utilities

## Release plan

- `0.1.0` - First beta release with stable API for current utilities
- `0.2.0` - Additional utilities (throttle, clamp, deepEqual)
- `1.0.0` - Stable release with full test coverage and documentation

## Long-term considerations

- Optional React hooks package (`@kompkit/react`)
- Optional Vue composables package (`@kompkit/vue`)
- UI component library (post-1.0)
- Additional platform support (iOS, Flutter)

Timelines are subject to change based on community feedback and contributions.
